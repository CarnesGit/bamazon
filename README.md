# bamazon
A MySQL and Node.js application simulating amazon with a database storing products and product info, and a CLA in node to buy and look up items. (No items are really for sale)!

First open the app in terminal by entering node and bamazonCustomer.js, press enter.

As long as there is sufficient quantity the app will update the stock quantity to reflect your purchase.
